            <p class="article-bio">"The point is always in the little things ... and only I can see them." Bostonian
                Eric Thorne speaks
                multiple languages ​​and is in the top 2% of scouts. After school, he went to serve in the US Army and
                quickly moved up the career ladder. Having learned dari, Thorn went into intelligence and was
                transferred to Kabul - the favorite city of foreign journalists, adventurers and criminals. Among
                underground figures and local residents, he became famous as a skillful buzkash player. Thorn was
                invited to "The Unit" as an expert on the region.<br><br><br> He was left in Kabul and tasked with
                collecting
                data,
                setting up agent networks, organizing turnouts and tracking down enemies. When the situation in the city
                began to deteriorate, the operative took up the safety of the Americans and helped the locals whose
                lives were in danger. Thorne was investigating the case of the missing journalist - and suddenly
                disappeared. Two years later, he stepped out of the shadows and provided enough data to thwart the
                insurgency.<br><br><br> Despite the suspicious disappearance, Thorn was exonerated and his testimony was
                classified.
                Success in the service and the skill of the operative caught the attention of Six. PSYCHOLOGICAL
                PORTRAIT "I knew about operative Maverick even before he disappeared. Among the scouts, he has earned a
                reputation as an agent who" became local. " the conversation can go on forever. [...] A city where old
                people make money by selling love letters on the corner ... no wonder he was fascinated by Afghanistan
                and its culture. When expats flooded clandestine clubs and binge in restaurants, Operative Thorn he
                understood that soon the guests from the West would have a hard time. He realized before many that a
                catastrophe was coming. [...]<br><br><br> From an early age, Eric Thorne had to cope with a colossal
                stream of
                feelings, but he did not close in himself. Instead, he began to deconstruct and categorize everything
                This is one of the reasons why the operative hides his emotions. [...] <br><br><br>The parents loved
                their son,
                but
                were quite strict and rarely allowed go home. Therefore, Thorne went to the army - to see a world that
                he could only imagine in his dreams before. No wonder Kabul made such an impression on him. It seems
                that he got out of his "shell" only when he began to travel. And even though Eric is physically with us,
                his heart belongs to Kabul. [...] Operative Thorn has incredible empathy through his ability to observe,
                listen and analyze. People trust him and help him survive anywhere - even in Kabul. […]<br><br><br> I
                continue
                to
                review the reports of his disappearance. They read like a real thriller, but at the same time, it
                becomes clear how great Thorn's connection with Afghanistan is. I think the tattoo reminds him of a past
                life.</p>
